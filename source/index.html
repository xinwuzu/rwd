			In traditional design theory of asphalt pavement,elastic layered system subjected static double-circle load with uniform distribution is the main research object,which neglects the visco-elastic properties of pavement material and the dynamic characteristic of load.With the rapidly increase of the proportion of Heavy-Duty and overload transportation,the traditional design theory had more and more serious underestimation to the actual situation.The early damage of asphalt pavement is getting serious.

		<p>
			Firstly,conducted a survey on the spot to get the load parameter and arranged the Dynamic Modulus Test to obtain the visco-elastic parameters of pavement materials.Secondly,in consideration of the visco-elastic properties of pavement materials and the dynamic character of load,made use of ABAQUS digital simulation platform to carry out a user subroutine DLOAD and establish the dynamic analysis model of the pavement.Lastly,the comparison and analysis of vertical stress field and strain field were implemented.

		<p>
			The research indicates that anti-rutting asphalt modifier can increase the modulus of asphalt mixtures;The existing design load has a serious underestimation to the actual situation;A reasonable modulus combination of modulus is key to raise the anti-rutting properties of the pavement.
